# Neural Network in C
This is an amateur (and possibly very na√Øve) attempt at implementing a multiple-layer Neural Network and a Matrix operation library (with GPU optimization???) in the glorious language of C. Updates to this repo will probably not be too frequent.

### Goals of the project
* Implement a Matrix mathematical operations library.
* Implement a (semi-)efficient two-pass Neural Network: Forward-pass and Backpropagation.
* Extend the Matrix library for hardware acceleration (using the GPU; OpenCL or CUDA for NVIDIA).
* Profit?!?!
